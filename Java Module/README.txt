# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
I made a desktop helper. Something rather simple that gives you a motivational quote, gives a random genre of music, and makes a break counter.

I wanted to make something for myself to use as this could be a helpful tool for me

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
